## 📊 Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification.
It focuses on analyzing daily page views from the FreeCodeCamp forum and visualizing trends using Python libraries.



## 🎯 Objective

To clean and analyze a time series dataset, then generate:

A line plot to show overall trends

A bar plot to visualize monthly averages by year

Two box plots to reveal yearly and monthly patterns




## 📁 Dataset

Daily page views from May 2016 to December 2019

Outliers removed by filtering the top and bottom 2.5% of data



## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

NumPy



## 📊 Visualizations

✅ Line Plot

Highlights the long-term trend of forum activity.

✅ Bar Plot

Shows monthly averages grouped by year, useful for comparing user engagement across time.

✅ Box Plots

Year-wise: Displays data distribution per year

Month-wise: Reveals seasonal trends across all years




## 📌 Key Learnings

Time series data cleaning using Pandas

Outlier detection and filtering

Generating clear and insightful visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib

Interpreting long-term and seasonal trends in user activity



## 🔍 Conclusion

This project helped strengthen skills in data cleaning, visualization, and trend analysis.
By transforming raw data into visual insights, it demonstrates how Python can be used to uncover patterns in real-world datasets.
The combination of line, bar, and box plots provided a multi-dimensional view of user behavior over time.
